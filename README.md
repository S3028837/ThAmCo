## ThAmCo.Catering

I am currently working on the catering web service part of the project.  

### Database

**Challenges:**  
  
Relationships between databases  
- Had trouble understanding the realtionships between the tables in the database.  
I used Microsoft Copilot and looked at previous projects to help me understand it.  

### API  

**Challenges**  
  
Understanding DTO  
- Had trouble figuring out the code for the DTOs for each class.  
Barry helped me understand it.  
Decided to pause progress on DTO for now as I dont think it is the most important requirement for me to follow.  
  
- Had trouble using DTOs to list the FoodItems of a specified Menu.  
Barry and another student (Ben Shafto) helped me undersrand the direction to go in.

### Database Classes

Working on creating each class for the catering database(db).  
Trying to define the many-to-one relationships has proven dificult between the classes.
I have been making use of AI (Microsoft Copilot) and previous projects to try and understand the relationships.  
  
I have also made use of Copilot to generate test data for the database.
